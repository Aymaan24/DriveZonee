                        of the BMW Vision M NEXT is evident at first glance. Its
                        emotion-stirring exterior design clearly announces the
                        BMW Vision Vehicle’s performance potential. The striking
                        proportions of the sports car are enhanced by a clear,
                        pared-down surface language. This impression is
                        reinforced at the front and rear ends in particular by
                        the matt-neon shade Thrilling Orange, producing a vivid
                        contrast against the exterior’s otherwise silk-matt Cast

                                groundbreaking BMW i8 for inspiration. In line
                                with the new BMW design strategy, the BMW Vision
                                M NEXT exudes a powerful character with its

                            the outer edges of the front end, above the kidney
                            grille. Arranged one above the other rather than
                            side by side, their constituent elements represent a

                            coated with phosphorous are used to produce

                            The Power-PHEV drive of the BMW Vision M NEXT allows
                            the driver to choose between four electrically
                            driven wheels or a purist rear-wheel drive – purely
                            electrically or accelerated by turbocharged
                            4-cylinder petrol engine. A system output of 441kW
                            (600 hp) permits a top speed of up to 300 km/h and
                            catapults the BMW Vision M NEXT from 0 to 100 km/h
                            in 3 seconds. The range in purely electric driving
                            mode extends up to 100 km – in most cases this is
                            sufficient to cover a large proportion of journeys
                            purely electrically. Consequently, the BMW Vision M
                            NEXT is also a future-proof sports car for inner
                            cities with potential zero-emissions zones. <br>
