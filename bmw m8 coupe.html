                            comfortable everyday usability. The running gear
                            concept includes electronically controlled shock
                            absorbers, active stabilisers and Integral Active
                            Steering. Active roll stabilisation with active

                            of the body – when cornering or driving over
                            potholes and other obstacles. The advantages of this
                            system are especially evident when using a
                            particularly dynamic driving style: the vehicle
                            becomes significantly more agile with easier
                            cornering. In addition, the absorption of lateral
                            forces increases comfort for the passengers in the
                            second row of seats. Integral Active Steering also
                            supports more dynamic and safer driving dynamics. At
                            higher speeds, the rear wheels turn parallel to the
                            front wheels to stabilise the vehicle. In the lower
                            speed range, the rear wheels steer in the opposite
                            direction, making your vehicle more agile. <br> <br>

                            From smooth sailing to dynamic driving with very
                            sporty gear changes: The fourth-generation 8-speed M
                            Steptronic sport transmission puts a wide range at
                            your disposal. In addition to automatic gear
                            selection, you also have the option of sporty manual
                            gear shifts via paddles on the steering wheel. In
                            SPORT mode and by actuating the electronic selector
                            lever (switch: S/M), experience gear shifts that are
                            configured for the best possible performance. The
                            sporting character has two elements: The first is
                            that the engine always maintains a high engine speed
                            range at which it can access plenty of power output.
                            The second element shortens the switching sequences
                            even further. The Launch Control function permits
                            maximum acceleration from a standing start. When set
                            to automatic mode, the gear selection adapts itself
                            to suit individual driving styles. In manual mode,
                            however, an optimum shift indicator gives you
                            recommendations for efficient driving. The Shift
                            Lights (in the instrument cluster and on the BMW
                            Head-up display) also help in highly dynamic driving
                            in the upper engine speed range. At high speeds, the
                            eighth gear reduces engine speed and fuel
                            consumption. This is also where the powerful
                            converter clutch comes into play. In short: The
                            8-speed M Steptronic sport transmission of the
                            fourth generation works together with the engine to
                            deliver smooth gear shifts and top levels of power
                            delivery and shift comfort as well as impressive
                            efficiency. <br> <br> <br>
