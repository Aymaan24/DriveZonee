            The F80 has a strongly futuristic visual impact with unmistakeable references to aerospace. The architecture is defined by a dihedral cross section with its two bottom corners firmly planted on the wheels. From the side view, the rear section has a sculpted flow that emphasises the muscularity of the entire rear wing. The front section of the car is defined by more architectural elements: the wheelarch ends with a vertical panel that stands proud of the door, paying homage to the visual language of the F40.
